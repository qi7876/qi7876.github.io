# Hello, I'm Qi

Nice to meet you!

## Hobbies

1. Tinkering with anything computer-related;
1. Fitness;
1. Listening to music—favorite genres are Citypop and R&B.

## Research Interests

My current interest and work focus is on multimodal large models.

My previous interests:

1. Computer networks.

My previous work areas (unfortunately not my interest areas):

1. Computer vision (specifically high-resolution image fusion);
1. Anomaly log detection.

## Projects

Projects I consider quite interesting:

1. **[Capacitance-based Gesture Recognition Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Machine](https://github.com/qi7876/EPI-2024-Spring)** - My freshman spring Engineering Project Innovation I course project (with high creative freedom—unfortunately, the newer cohorts have fixed directions, which is somewhat regrettable. I saw the next cohort's presentations and felt they lacked the diversity of our year). Very interesting project where we used a capacitive board to detect gestures (medium-high accuracy), with data read and processed by an ESP32 microcontroller. It also features a simple GUI interface and a clever opponent bot. Won third place in the college's Academic Month event. This repo contains only the microcontroller code.
1. **[AI Agent Controls Software Protocol](https://github.com/qi7876/AACSP)** - A very rudimentary toy project, but the concept felt quite intriguing. I designed a tree-structured Agent protocol. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and deadline pressure, I had to rush through it. Hopefully, I can refine it later. Won first place in the college's Academic Month event.
1. **[LLMlog](https://github.com/qi7876/llm-log)** - An LLM-based anomaly log detection system with zero training overhead, using RAG and supporting both online and offline detection. After seven months of dedication, it unfortunately didn't yield substantial results. As my first formal research project, I'll keep it here as a memento. Though this project didn't succeed, I learned a lot from it. Thanks to Prof. Jingwei Li for his guidance and support!
1. **[Nvim config](https://github.com/qi7876/nvim-config)** - My personally maintained Neovim configuration. I spent a lot of time on it last year, pursuing simplicity and speed, suitable for daily coding. For debugging, please use more powerful tools like VS Code or JetBrains IDEs.

## Education

1. **Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)** - Bachelor's degree, 2023.8–Present
