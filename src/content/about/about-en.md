# Hello, I'm Qi  

Nice to meet you!  

## Hobbies  

1. Tinkering with anything computer-related;  
1. Fitness;  
1. Listening to music—favorite genres are Citypop and R&B.  

## Research Interests  

My current focus is on multimodal large models.  

Previous research areas:  

1. Computer vision;  
1. Anomaly log detection.  

## Projects  

Some projects I find quite interesting:  

1. **[AI Agent Controls Software Protocol](https://github.com/qi7876/AACSP)** – A very rudimentary toy project, powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro. The idea felt intriguing, but due to time constraints and looming deadlines, I had to rush through it with some "vibe coding." Hopefully, I can refine it later.  
1. **[LLMlog](https://github.com/qi7876/llm-log)** – An anomaly log detection system based on LLMs, with zero training overhead, supporting both online and offline detection. The idea wasn’t great, and after seven months of hard work, it didn’t yield solid results. As my first formal research project, I’ll keep it here as a memento. Maybe if I had been braver and asked my advisor to switch projects, things would’ve turned out differently—but no regrets, as I still learned a lot.  

## Education  

1. **Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)** – Bachelor’s degree, 2023.8–Present  

## Work Experience  

1. **School of Mathematics, UESTC** – Research Assistant in Prof. Liangjian Deng’s group, 2023.12–2024.3;  
1. **School of Cybersecurity, UESTC** – Research Assistant in Prof. Jingwei Li’s group, 2024.10–2025.5;  
1. **School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University** – Research Assistant in Prof. Zhipeng Zhang’s group, 2025.7–Present.
